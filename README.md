# What I Learned

## Creando una aplicaci√≥n paso a paso

- I learned the basics of React.js, including its definition, popularity, and fundamental concepts. Additionally, I built my first components and created a React.js application from scratch.

## Creating a React app using create-react-app

- I discovered how to use create-react-app, a well-known tool for bootstrapping React.js projects, to set up my development environment. Also, I learned how to manage dependencies with npm.

## Creating custom Hooks and using Context to achieve global state in ReactJS

- I explored the use of custom hooks and context in React.js applications to share state across components. Specifically, I created custom hooks and utilized the useContext hook to achieve global state.

## Lazy Loading, Suspense, and Pagination with React

- I learned how to implement lazy loading, suspense, and pagination in React.js applications. I also gained familiarity with the react-lazyload and react-paginate libraries for easier implementation.

## CSS Grid, Infinite Scroll, and Tests in our React App

- I discovered how to apply CSS Grid and Infinite Scroll in React.js applications. Moreover, I learned how to test my components using Jest and React Testing Library.

## Using React.memo, Improving Performance, and Deploying with Vercel in our React App

- I explored the use of React.memo to optimize the performance of React.js applications. Additionally, I learned how to deploy my application using Vercel, a popular platform for hosting and deploying web applications.

## SEO with React and Integrated Deploy with Github

- I gained knowledge on optimizing React.js applications for search engine optimization (SEO). Furthermore, I learned how to host and deploy my application using Github.

## useReducer and Hooks Testing with react-hooks-testing-library

- I learned how to use the useReducer hook to manage state in React.js applications. Furthermore, I discovered how to test my hooks using the react-hooks-testing-library.

## Next steps

- While the application is functional, there are additional features I would like to implement. Specifically, I plan to integrate node.js with a database, potentially using MongoDB, to enable user registration and login functionality with persistent storage.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
